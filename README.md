#Leasemon v0.5
##What is this?
This is just a simple application that I build to help me get a better idea of where I'm at with my car lease milleage usage. After searching for something that did this for a while I decided to just write it myself. 

Plus it gave me an excuse to play with Backbone, Bootstrap 3, Grunt and Bower.
